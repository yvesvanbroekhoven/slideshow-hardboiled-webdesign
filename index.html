            <h2>Progressive enhancement</h2>
            <blockquote>
              Progressive enhancement is an approach to web design that builds documents for the least capable devices first, then moves on to enhance those documents... To allow a richer experience for those users with modern graphical browser software.

              <li>lean, clean, semantic HTML</li>

            <h2>Maybe we could turn progressive enhancement into progressive enrichment?</h2>
            <blockquote>
              We should treat these visual details as rewards for the browsers that support the advanced code that creates them. We're visually rewarding users of browsers that are forward thinking. That's the core of the term progressive enrichment

            <h2>The answer is consider how each progressively less capable browser will render a design</h2>

            <h2>Hey but isn't that graceful degradation?</h2>
            <blockquote>
              Graceful degradation ensures that when styles & scripts are not available or understood, the content will remain accessible.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Considering accessibility and how websites function in older browsers is a fundamentally important part of what we do. But the term gracefull degration, as traditionally applied to visual design, implies that we should compromise.</p>

            <blockquote>
              We need to step back from our endless battle to make it look the same across all platforms. We can't make our site look the same on a PDA as a 27" monitor. We can't make our site the same for someone on a speaking browser, and although things are improving there are still differences in support and implementation of various W3C standards. Let go, it's not going to look the same.
